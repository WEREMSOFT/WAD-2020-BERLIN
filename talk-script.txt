Intro

The frontend development is broken.


Webapps are slow, big and drain your battery faster.


Every time you procastinate waiting for a process to finish, every time you have to delete photos from your phone, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU run out of battery in the middle of the day, you have a taste of how broken our field is.


BUT TODAY, we are going to fix frontend development by improving our own user experience.


We are going to learn how to make web apps that are FAST, SMALL and POWER EFFICIENT.

FAST, SMALL, POWER EFICIENT. 


In this talk, we are going to focus in what we don't want for our own experience.


We don't want to wait.
We don't want to run out of space.
We don't want to run out of battery.

FAST, SMALL, POWER EFICIENT. Let's talk about how to get FAST.

There are some discussions about performance on the browser, some benchmarks here and there, but they are not meaningfull.

But the fact that you are not VERY VERY SLOW, doen't meant that you are not SLOW.

And we don't want to be NOT-SLOW, WE WANT TO BE FAST!.

So, we are goint to talk about cache, but not browser cache, but CPU cache.

If you trash your cache, your program becomes very very slow. Doesn't matters what language you use.

We can be a little bit faster using multi threads, we can be a little bit faster using SIMD, but NONE OF THEM MAKES YOU 19 TIMES FASTER!!!

The way to get FAST is putting all data toguether and process it on one go.

The way to be VERY FAST.

We can go an extra mile by splitting our structures in Stricture of Arrays(SOA), but this can be hard. Gladly we have 2 frameworks that helps us. ECSY(by mozilla) and FLECS. FLECS is made in C99, to it compiles to any other languaje(including WASM).

Using a ECS framework solves 3 problems at the same time: It's cache friendly on Single Thread, Is cache friendly in Multi Thread environments, and is SIMD compatible. 

As you can see, the advantajes stack toguether creating code that is VERY, VERY FAST.

Let's talk about how to get SMALL.

We are developers, we think of ourselve as the greenest industry. The factory without chimneys. We create assets without polluting the environment. And that's NOT true.

It's estimated that transfer 1 GB of data on internet requires 0.5 kW.

If you have a web app that is 1MB big, every time you serve it to 10.000 unique users, you create 29 tons of CO2.
